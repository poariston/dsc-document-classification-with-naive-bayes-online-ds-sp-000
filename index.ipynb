    "A common example of using Bayes' theorem to classify documents is a spam filtering algorithm. You'll be exploring this application in the upcoming lab. To do this, you examine the question \"given this word (in the document) what is the probability that it is spam versus not spam?\" For example, perhaps you get a lot of \"special offer\" spam. In that case, the words \"special\" and \"offer\" may increase the probability that a given message is spam.\n",
